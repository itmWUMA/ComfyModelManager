## Why

Users cannot distinguish the purpose of two browse buttons in the settings screen and do not know which paths to provide. This leads to confusion and misconfiguration that blocks setup.

## What Changes

- Clarify the two browse actions with explicit labels, helper text, and validation messaging that indicates the expected path type.
- Adjust the interaction flow so each browse button is tied to a clearly described field and selection result.
- Add visual cues or inline examples that make the required paths unambiguous.

## Capabilities

### Modified Capabilities
